DD-DOS Goodies
===================

This repo includes goodies, such as tests, to run either under DD-DOS, DOSBox, or even MS-DOS.

Compiling
===================

The ASM files are compiled with the NASM assembler, be sure to use the binary format when compiling as COM executables.

The C files need to be compiled with an ANSI C or C89 compliant compiler, such as the Borland Turbo 2.0 C compiler or GCC using a DOS library.

To make a COM file using C, you can use Turbo C's /T switch: `tcc -mt -lt example.c`

It is recommended to use the 8086 instruction set.
